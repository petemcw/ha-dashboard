# Issue Tracker: GitHub

Issues for this repo live as GitHub issues.

## Access

Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Issue titles** use the vocabulary in `.farseer/domain.md`
- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Issue relationships

`gh` supports native blocked-by / blocking relationships as of **2.94.0** (check with `gh --version`). Use these instead of writing `#N` references into the body. GitHub renders them as real dependencies, surfaces them in the issue sidebar, and can filter on them.

**The flag names differ between subcommands.** `create` takes a plural, comma-separated list; `edit` takes `--add-`/`--remove-` prefixes:

```bash
# at creation — comma-separated, no spaces
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --blocked-by 200,201 --blocking 300

# after the fact
gh issue edit 123 --add-blocked-by 200 --add-blocking 300,301
gh issue edit 123 --remove-blocked-by 200
```

Both accept issue numbers or full URLs.

**When creating a set of issues from a plan, create them in dependency order** — blockers first — so each `--blocked-by` can reference an issue number that already exists. Otherwise a second `gh issue edit` pass is needed to wire up relationships.

A plan's task dependencies map directly: task 005's `**Depends on**: 002, 003` becomes `--blocked-by <issue for 002>,<issue for 003>` on the issue for task 005.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## This repo is public

`petemcw/ha-dashboard` is a public repository, so issue titles, bodies, and comments are public. Keep out of issues:

- Tokens, the HA-MCP URL path, passwords, or anything from `.env.local`.
- LAN IPs, tailnet hostnames beyond what's already in `CLAUDE.md`, and network layout.
- Entity IDs or state that reveal when the house is empty or how it's secured (locks, alarm, presence, cameras). Describe the capability ("door lock tile") instead.
